# EventHub
### Dual-study Softserve project
> EventHub is like a busy marketplace where people can easily check out different events or even plan their own. It's all about helping folks make new friends and have meaningful chats. With its easy-to-use setup and lots of options, EventHub is like a virtual meeting spot for those who want to hang out with people who share their interests, find cool stuff to do, and meet new pals. Whether you're into concerts, hiking, or book clubs, EventHub lets you connect with others, swap stories, and build friendships that go beyond just your local area.
